1. Main Objective of the Analysis : 
The main objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict two outcomes:
Whether a movie is nominated for an award (Oscar or Golden Globes).
Whether a movie has a high IMDb score (â‰¥ 7.0).
For both objectives, we aim to develop models that will provide insightful predictions based on movie attributes such as genre, budget, director, and box office earnings. The analysis seeks to help stakeholders (such as producers and marketers) predict the likelihood of movie nominations and high IMDb ratings, potentially informing marketing strategies and production decisions.
